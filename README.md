# MEAN-Web-Application 
Mean Web Application built following "Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express By Jonathan Mills" course on Pluralsight. The result of completing the course is a web application with Node and Express that's got all the tooling wrapped around it that builds some routers to display pages, a MongoDB database on the backend that's serving up session information, and thirdâ€‘party API that is called to get the speaker information.
